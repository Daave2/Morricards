Before making changes, and after completing them, please review and update the following files to understand the project's structure and keep its status current:

1.  **`structure.md`**: Provides a detailed overview of the application architecture, file organization, and key data flows. This should be your primary reference for how to build new features.
2.  **`TODO.md`**: Tracks pending tasks and future ideas. Add items here that are requested but not yet implemented.
3.  **`CHANGELOG.md`**: After implementing a feature, add a summary of the work to this log under the current version.

By consulting and updating these documents, you can ensure your contributions are consistent with the existing design and that the project's progress is accurately tracked.
