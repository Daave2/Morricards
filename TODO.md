# Project TODO

This document tracks the pending tasks and future ideas for the Store Mobile Ultra application. For a history of completed work, see `CHANGELOG.md`.

## In Progress

-   **Refining UI consistency across all themes**: Ensuring all pages and components feel cohesive with the selected theme (Light, Dark, Glass).
-   **Investigating Build Warnings**:
    -   **Symptom**: `next build` produces warnings related to `instrumentation-winston` and `handlebars`.
    -   **Status**: These seem to be related to dependencies within the Genkit library. They don't appear to break the build, but they should be monitored.

## Future Ideas

-   Add a "chat with product" feature on the AI Assistant page.
-   Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
-   Explore generating shelf plans or planograms visually.
-   Add user authentication to save lists across devices.
-   Create an `ISSUES.md` log for persistent bugs, detailing symptoms and attempted fixes.
