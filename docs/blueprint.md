## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A020F0) to evoke a sense of modernity, aligned with retail and shopping. This color is versatile, working well in a variety of contexts while adding a unique flair.
- Background color: Light purple (#E6D7FC), desaturated and light to ensure it does not compete with the content, providing a clean backdrop for the card views.
- Accent color: Blue (#20A0F0), slightly analogous to purple on the color wheel, provides contrast and a visually appealing highlight for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Cards are laid out in a responsive grid, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent stock levels, location details, and other product attributes.
- Subtle transitions when loading or updating product information to enhance user experience without being distracting.
